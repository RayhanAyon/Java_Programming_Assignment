# Problem Solving In Java
## Project Summery 
Here I Have solved 14 basic level Programming Problem Using Java.
## Questions
- Problem 1: Here is the 10 students CGPA [3.50, 3.52, 3.43, 3.63, 3.48, 3.32, 3.30, 3.60, 3.86, 3.75]
     Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score. (without sorting, use linear searching algorithm)
- Problem 2: Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA (don’t use Arrays.sort() method, do it programmatically)
- Problem 3: Take a CGPA as user input. Now from the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm
- Problem 4: Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.
- Problem 5: Write a program that will break down the amount and count notes for any given amount. Here is the notes in the given array: notes=[1000,500,200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1] 

  Input: 546

  Output:

  500 1

  20 2

  5 1

  1 1
- Problem 6:  Write a program that will give following output:

- Problem 7: Take input as height of 10 babies in cm. Now find out the 2 lowest height of babies. (Don’t use Arrays.sort() method) 
- Problem 8:  Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant from the given string:

  Input: I am a SQA Engineer

  Output: 

  Words: 5

  Chars: 15

  Vowel: 8

  Consonant: 7
- Problem 9: Write a program that evaluates a string entered by the user to determine whether it is binary or not. 

  Example 1 input: 1001

  output: true

  Example 2 input: 2001

  output: false
- Problem 10: Generate random password which length is 8. Should follow this password strategy: Min 1 capital letter, min 1 small letter, min 1 digit and min 1 special character. 

  Sample output: 1eGh$3pH
- Problem 11: Remove Vowels from a String

  Input: I am a SQA Engineer

  Output: m sq ngn
- Problem 12: A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount? [Extract the digits from the paragraph and calculate the price] 
- Problem 14: Check if an IP address is valid or invalid. Conditions: 
  IP address must be in this pattern: [digit]:[digit]:[digit]:[digit]. First digit should not be 0 or not be single digit; 

  Example 1 input: 192.168.0.1

  Output: Valid IP

  Example 2 input: 172.16.56

  Output: Invalid IP

  Example 3 input: 0.0.0.1

  Output: Invalid IP

  Example 4 input: 1.12.72.2

  Output: Invalid IP
- Problem 15: In a question paper, there are total 15 questions. Some question mark is 10 and some question mark is 5 
  How much question needed if I totaling 100 mark for 5 marks and 10 marks ? 

  Output: 

  5 marks question is 10

  10 marks question is 5
